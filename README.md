YOLO is clones from https://github.com/experiencor/basic-yolo-keras
Thanks to experiencor!
I just use the YOLO code from there.
Let me know if I need to write more comments statements when I use his/her codes.

The tracker folder is my own work.
The concept is from http://guanghan.info/projects/ROLO/.
Thanks to Guanghan Ning!
The only difference is that I use YOLOv2 in this version.

This project is in progressing, now it still can't work properly.
